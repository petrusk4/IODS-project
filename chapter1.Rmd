## About the project

Hello, this is my page for the course "Introduction to open data science, 5 ECTS". Three friends of mine recommended this course and told great stuff about it. I have 2 years of experience with R, but now I want to take it to the next level. That's why I'm thrilled to learn Git, which I expect from this course.



Lastly, check out my [GitHub-repository](https://github.com/petrusk4/IODS-project). 

Let's enjoy this interesting course!


Best, Petrus
